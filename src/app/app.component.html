  <h2>Keyboard Navigation</h2>
  <p>
    You can navigate around the grids using your keyboard. Try the following key combinations:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Alt + ↑ / ↓ / ← / →</strong> – Move focus up, down, left, or right within a grid</li>
    <li><strong>Page Up / Page Down</strong> – Move to first/last columns</li>
    <li><strong>Home / End</strong> – Jump to the first or last items in a row</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="note">
    Each grid can contain different types of controls — text boxes, dropdowns, and read-only fields.  
    Try using the keyboard only to move through both grids and experience how Focusly manages focus seamlessly.
